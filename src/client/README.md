## Client App

### BEFORE DEVELOPMENT OR TESTING
  * `cd react-gbooks/src/client/bookshelf && npm install` to install dependencies 
  * `cd react-gbooks/src/server && npm start` to run the server on localhost:3030:  
    `Server says: Server proxies requests to the Google Books API`  
  or 
  * update the `"proxy"` field in `package.json` to point to some other server  
  If you haven't yet, `npm install` in `react-gbooks/src/server`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Troubleshooting `npm start` isn't detecting changes
Try `echo >> .env.development CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`  
["When set to true, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM."](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration#CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING)


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
